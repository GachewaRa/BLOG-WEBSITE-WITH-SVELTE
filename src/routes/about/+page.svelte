            I’m many things – that’s how I like to think of myself. But to establish contact with the ground, I’m a developer, and a writer committed to life-long learning, genuinely, for the sake of evolution. I think that the passage of time should bring us to higher levels of understanding and better ways of looking at things and doing things. So I want to utilize time in the best way possible – to evolve. Isn’t that the spiritual purpose of life anyway; evolving from lower to higher states?

            Time is the most scarce resource we have. In the words of George Gilder, “Time is the final measure of cost. Time is what remains scarce when all else becomes abundant.” Though this was said in the context of economics and technology, I believe that the principle is a general one. In the light of this, I think choosing to use time wisely is one of the wisest decisions anyone can make. For me, the decision was that for every time spent, I’d have something to show for it. I’m not the strict time budgeter, but I think I do have a subconscious drive to be involved in useful stuff, or make the stuff I’m involved in useful if I can’t choose what I’m involved in. I’ll read, watch, play, learn, walk, contemplate, write, design, build, explore and do other things, which from my standpoint, are supposed to add cumulatively in a compound manner. With time, these experiences, I believe, should make me better at any particular thing that I’ll set out to do at whatever point in the coming days. They should make me better at doing life in general, if I can put it that way.

            And this is where a tool like this digital journal comes in. At some point along the way, I realized that I needed some place to document what I was learning, to express myself, and to share that with the world.

            The learning I’m talking about started, or to be fair accelerated, when I finished high school. For some reason, I perceived that to be some form of jail-break, like how a caged bird would break free and head for the skies. When I was in school I was still curious, just that I saw school as sometimes interfering with my curiosity and learning. And when I was finally done, I jumped at the new opportunity to learn boundlessly. It’s been almost a decade, and I’ve explored many avenues. I’m grateful to all the authors and actors I’ve learned from (we are all actors, right?).

            In high school, they ingrained in us that ‘To those whom much has been given, much will be required’. There’s much that has been given to me in different ways, and for that my gratitude is immense. In turn, I want to give back too. It’s genuinely one of the reasons for setting up this digital journal. Having learned so much from others, I’d like for others too to learn from me.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I document what I’m learning, it reinforces my understanding of the concept while also helping others who might be on the same path. We are all escorting each other home.

            From my sojourns through different fields, I’ve learned much about myself as I’ve learned about the world. One of those things that I’ve learned about myself is that I should actively embrace my diverse interests and explore them as my intuition guides me to. For me, my intuition is one of the most handy tools at my disposal, and so far I’m thankful for the places it has taken me to, the discoveries I’ve made, and who I’ve become thus.

            By the time I completed high school, I wanted to pursue computer science as a career, but the winds that were blowing around that time of the year saw my boat docking in architecture school. I could have been grumpy, but with a little attention I saw the field as quite fascinating. So I learned on. My formal professional background is in architecture. But my passion for computer science and technology lingered. I kept the fire burning by reading books about technology to captivate my passion and kindle my imagination. I read The Second Machine Age, Artificial Intelligence and the End of Human Era, Life After Google, The Master Switch, among others. They were fascinating. After graduating from fourth year, I took the detour and got into a web development bootcamp to kickstart my career in tech.
